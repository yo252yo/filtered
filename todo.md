"Navigate your stream carefully cause the monsters of the past are haunting this grim grim world "



hi guys, im currently taking part in the neuro sama game jam organised by an AI vtuber that I like, and the theme being "remnants of the past" immediately brought to mind that the entire world is organized through a domination system resulting directly from a destructive colonial imperialism that capital tries its best to keep invisible, and AIs will contribute to cement this status quo in their training dataset so i thought its a great chance for a pedagogical project but im concerned it might be too cringe and not engouh gameplay, people always tell me i dont do enough gameplay, so if anyone can spare a few moments to beta test https://yo252yo.com/filtered/  and give me some feedback (even if the feedback is "dont publish that its social suicide") id be most grateful
